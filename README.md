# EEGStyleGAN-ADA
Pytorch code of paper "Learning Robust Deep Visual Representations from EEG Brain Recordings."

1. For StyleGAN-ADA, we have used the official Pytorch implementation. [[link]](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch)
2. Some network weights are not added due to file size restrictions on GitHub, and it's impossible to add them here without breaking anonymity, so we will release it later.
